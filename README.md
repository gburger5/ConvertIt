Convert-It: Length
- Convert-It is my version of an app challenge created by Paul Hudson in the 100 Days of SwiftUI
- Convert-It Purpose:
- Convert between all length values.

This Project Taught Me:
- How to use if statements to influence an outcome displayed on the UI
- How to manipulate state variables through ForEach loops
- How to successfully implement multiple structures and variable styles into one cohesive project
